DESIGN RATIONALE:

PROMOTER:
  CMV promoter selected for strong, constitutive expression in mammalian cells. Widely used in mRNA vaccine applications and provides reliable high-level expression.

KOZAK:
  Optimal Kozak sequence (GCCACCATGG) included to maximize translation efficiency. Critical for high protein expression levels.

SIGNAL_PEPTIDE:
  tPA signal peptide ensures proper targeting to the ER for MHC class I presentation pathway. Essential for neoantigen processing and presentation to T cells.

NEOANTIGEN:
  Neoantigen X (KTVNMRLGL) with flanking sequences for improved processing. Codon-optimized for human expression to maximize mRNA stability and translation efficiency.

TAGS:
  His-tag enables protein purification for quality control. FLAG tag allows detection and quantification of expression levels. Critical for validating vaccine efficacy.

TERMINATOR:
  BGH polyadenylation signal provides efficient transcription termination and mRNA stability, essential for mRNA vaccine applications.

SELECTION:
  Ampicillin resistance gene enables selection of successfully transformed bacterial cells during plasmid production and amplification.

ORIGIN:
  ColE1 origin of replication allows high-copy plasmid propagation in E. coli for efficient production and purification.
